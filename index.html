            <p>So, I'm sure you <em>("you" being anyone who may have happened opon this page)</em> are
            wondering why this page exists. Or, even better, why I - being the srange one I am - 
        even made it in the first place. The quickest answer is this, I somehow lost all the old files
    from my first computer science class where I made many old html projects I could include in my 
portfolio. I have my old Alice projects, but that's a whole other thing.
<br>Here is the part where I admit I have some very simple html projects that still 
exist out there, but nothing I would feel like is worth sharing. So here I am, recreating a practice page
for my portfolio. </p>
